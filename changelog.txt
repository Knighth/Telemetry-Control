Telemetry Control change log

v1.2.2-f3 Build_02
------------------
+ workshop release
+ additional code added to handle workshopad panel being disabled when the panel is reloaded
  coming back to main menu from map\asset\game. previously the standard "-noworkshop" message
  was reloading instead of our message. jury rigged some stuff to replace it after a second passes.
- Removed the no-nothing MachineInfo and GameStart up event checkboxes, feed back suggests it
  might only cause confusion.
+ Updated Assembly-Csharp patched dll for 1.2.2-f3 for anyone that wants to use it.
+ Trapped for and added some code to prevent and exception case where app was closing but
  we were trying to reset the panel back to normal but the panel had already been destroyed.
  We handle now in both trying not to run that code if we can detect application quiting,
  and even if it does and error we catch the nullref and only log it if debuglogging is on.
